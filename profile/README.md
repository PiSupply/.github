## Open Source Hardware
Pi Supply is committed to open source hardware and has developed a number of products that are designed to be fully compatible with the Raspberry Pi and other open source hardware platforms. These products are designed with open source principles in mind, which means that the designs and schematics are freely available for anyone to access and modify.

One of the most notable examples of Pi Supply's open source hardware is the PiJuice, a portable battery solution for the Raspberry Pi that enables users to take their projects on the go without needing a power outlet. The PiJuice is fully open source, with all of the design files, software, and schematics freely available on GitHub. This allows users to modify and customize the PiJuice to suit their specific needs.

In addition to the PiJuice, Pi Supply has also developed a number of other open source hardware products, including the JustBoom line of audio products, which are designed to work seamlessly with the Raspberry Pi to provide high-quality audio playback. These products are also fully open source, enabling users to modify and customize them as needed.

Overall, Pi Supply's commitment to open source hardware reflects the company's dedication to empowering makers and DIY enthusiasts by providing them with the tools they need to bring their ideas to life.
